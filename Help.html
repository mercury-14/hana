<p>“You won’t understand what I mean now, but someday you will: the only trick of friendship,
    I think, is to find people who are better than you are—not smarter, not cooler, but kinder,
    and more generous, and more forgiving—and then to appreciate them for what they can teach 
    you, and to try to listen to them when they tell you something about yourself, no matter
    how bad—or good—it might be, and to trust them, which is the hardest thing of all. But 
    the best, as well.”</p>

<img src="jk.jpg" alt="">

<p>Joanne Rowling CH, OBE, (/ˈroʊlɪŋ/ ROH-ling; born 31 July 1965), 
better known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British author and philanthropist. 
She is best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series, which has won multiple
awards and sold more than 500 million copies, becoming the best-selling book series
in history.The books are the basis of a popular film series, over which Rowling had
overall approval on the scripts and was a producer on the final films. She also
writes crime fiction under the pen name Robert Galbraith.
Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and 
bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the
Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990. 
The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, birth of her first child,
divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, 
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. There were six sequels, of
which the last was released in 2007. Since then, Rowling has written several books for adult readers:
The Casual Vacancy (2012) and—under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith—the crime fiction Cormoran
Strike series. In 2020, her "political fairytale" for children, The Ickabog, 
was released in instalment in an online version.</p>

American unrest. A number of his songs, such as "Blowin' in the Wind" and "The Times 
They Are a-Changing'", became anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements.

album charts at #1, making him, 
at age sixty five, the oldest living person to top those charts.</p>
