<h1><b>BOOKS</b></h1>
<p>A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of
many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover.
The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In the history of
hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its
predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes
a considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read.
In a restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, 
a usage that reflects the fact that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and
each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. Each part of Aristotle's Physics is called a
book. 
In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books 
or chapters or parts, 
are parts.

<p><b></b><h1>10 BEST BOOKS OF THE 21ST CENTURY</h1></p>
<div>
<ul>
<img src="Ifeelbadaboutmyneck.jpg">
<li><b>I FEEL BAD ABOUT MY NECK     </b> <i>BY NORA EPHRON(2006)</i>
<p>Perhaps better known for her screenwriting (Silkwood, When Harry Met Sally, Heartburn),
Ephron’s brand of smart theatrical humour is on best display in her essays. Confiding and 
self-deprecating, she has a way of always managing to sound like your best friend – even when 
writing about her apartment on New York’s Upper West Side. This wildly enjoyable collection includes
her droll observations about ageing, vanity – 
and a scorching appraisal of Bill Clinton.</p> <br>
<img src="dragontattoo.jpg">

<li><b>THE GIRL WITH A DRAGON TATTOO   </b><I>BY STIEG LARSSON (2005),TRANSLATED BY STEVEN T MURRAY(2008)</I><p>Radical journalist Mikael Blomkvist
    forms an unlikely alliance with troubled young hacker Lisbeth Salander as they follow a trail of
murder and malfeasance connected with one of Sweden’s most powerful families in the first novel of
the bestselling Millennium trilogy. The high-level intrigue beguiled millions of readers, 
    brought “Scandi noir” to prominence and inspired innumerable copycats.</p><br><br><br><br>
<img src="broken glass.jpg">

<li><b>BROKEN GLASS  </b><i>BY ALAIN MABANCKOU(2005),TRANSLATED BY HELEN STEVENSON(2009)
<p>The Congolese writer says he was “trying to break the French language” with Broken Glass –
a black comedy told by a disgraced teacher without much in the way of full stops or paragraph breaks. 
As Mabanckou’s unreliable narrator munches his “bicycle chicken” and drinks his red wine, it becomes
clear he has the history of Congo-Brazzaville and
the whole of French literature in his sights.</p><br><br><br><br>
<img src="harry potter.jpg">
<li><b>HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE </b><i>BY JK ROWLING(2000)</i></li><P>A generation grew up on Rowling’s
all-conquering magical fantasies, but countless adults have also been enthralled by her immersive.
Book four, the first of the doorstoppers, marks the point where the series really takes off.
The Triwizard Tournament provides pace and tension, and Rowling makes her boy wizard look death
in the eye for the first time.</P>
</i></li>
<img src="a little life.jpg">
<li><b>A LITTLE LIFE </b><i>BY HANYA YANAGIHARA (2015) 
<P>This operatically harrowing American gay melodrama became an unlikely bestseller, 
and one of the most divisive novels of the century so far. One man’s life is blighted
by abuse and its aftermath, but also illuminated by love and friendship. Some readers
wept all night, some condemned it as titillating and exploitative,
but no one could deny its power.</P>
</i></li>
<img src="Bob_Dylan_Chronicles.jpg">
<body><b>CHRONICLES : VOLUME ONE  </b><i>BY BOB DYLAN(2004)</i><li>
<P>Dylan’s reticence about his personal life is a central part of the singer-songwriter’s brand, 
so the gaps and omissions in this memoir come as no surprise. The result is both sharp and dreamy, 
sliding in and out of different phases of Dylan’s career but rooted in his earliest days as a 
Woody Guthrie wannabe in New York City. 
Fans are still waiting for volume two.</P>
</li><img src="the tipping.jpg">
<li><b>THE TIPPING POINT </b><I>BY MALCOLM GLADWELL(2000)</I></li>
<p>The New Yorker staff writer examines phenomena from shoe sales to crime rates through the lens of epidemiology, 
reaching his own tipping point, when he became a rock-star intellectual and unleashed a wave of quirky studies 
contemporary society. Two decades on, Gladwell is often accused of over simplification
and cherry picking, but his idiosyncratic bestsellers have helped shape 21st-century culture.</p>
<img src="darkmans.jpg">
<li><b>DARKMANS </b><i>BY NICOLA BARKER(2007)</i></li>
<p>British fiction’s most anarchic author is as prolific as she is playful,
but this freewheeling, visionary epic set around the Thames Gateway is her magnum opus.
Barker brings her customary linguistic invention and wild humour to a tale about history’s hold on the present,
as contemporary Ashford is haunted by the spirit of a medieval jester.</p>
<li><b>THE SIEGE </b> <i>BY HELEN DUNMORE(2001)</i></li>
<img src="the siege.jpg">
<p>The Levin family battle against starvation in this novel set during the German siege of Leningrad.
Anna digs tank traps and dodges patrols as she scavenges for wood,
but the hand of history is hard to escape.</p> <br><br><br><br>

<li><b>LIGHT</b> <i>BY M JOHN HARRISON</i></li>
<p>One of the most underrated prose writers demonstrates the literary firepower of
science fiction at its best. Three narrative strands – spanning far-future space opera,
contemporary unease and virtual-reality pastiche – are braided together for a breathtaking metaphysical
voyage in pursuit of the mystery at the heart of reality.</p>
